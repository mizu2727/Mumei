This 3D model was created by Mr Artist from scratch using Autodesk Maya.
The model is not an exact replica of any branded or patented firearm accessory.
It is intended for educational, entertainment, and game development purposes only.

Asset Store Validator shows a model import warning, but there are no warnings in the Console. Model imports cleanly and performs correctly in Unity. Please ignore if cached validator data is causing this.

Thankyou for downloading from Mr. Artist.
